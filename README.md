get a list of products from the etsy api

All that is needed is to pull the repo locally and as long as you have npm installed already then... 
run "npm install"
to create the directory for the node_module dependencies.  I have added more dependancies than I used because I anticipate flushing this page out.
If you want to use live-server...
run npm start

Currently the pagination is not finished, you can only go forward in page sets.  And the javascript is not scoped out correctly.  I need to either objectify or modularize the current code.  But it is in vanilla javascript.

I have also not had time to set up the js tests.

ONLY FUNCTIONALLY TESTED ON CHROME 

TBD:

1. refactor js

2. write some tests

3. finish pagination

4. write final tests

Nice To Have:

1. filters in header nav
